# Crypto Arbitrage

The engine collects all crypto currency pair data from ~20 exchanges via www.cryptowat.ch API and calculates ~35.000 possible arbitrage strategies. It also considers FOREX conversion rates when buying and selling cryptos.

Data is collected and processed on a server and pushed to the Shiny R environment all 30 minutes. Details about the arbitrage strategies are covered in one of my blog posts.
